#Hive Sweeper

*I wanted to try out the TypeScript bindings for AngularJS, so I made a game!*

It works pretty much like Minesweeper, only with hexagons instead of squares.

###How to play
- Click a tile to uncover it. If it's a mine, you lose. If it isn't a mine, it will tell you how many mines are adjacent to it.  
- If you think a tile has a mine on it, right-click to flag the tile.
- Uncover all non-mine tiles to win!

#"whatever, just let me play it"
OK! [here you go](http://tim1.ucc.asn.au/hivesweeper/ "here you go")
